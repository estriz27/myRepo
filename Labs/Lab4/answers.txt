1. Although no forks were made, it is clear that the processes have the ability to send data to eachother, as demonstrated in echod.c and echoreq.c.

2. Socket functionality is provided by an external library. This is justified by the include statement for the external library <sys/socket.h>. Without this import statment, the use of sockets wouldn't be possible. The functions in the library make calls to the kernel.

3. The main difference when chosing whether to use pipes or sockets depends on if the program needs the ability to communicate over a network, or whether it will communicate with local procesess. If it has to communicate over a network, it would make sense to use sockets instead of pipes. If it only needs to communicate with processes that are local, pipes will do the job.

4. gethostbyname(3) returns a pointer of an internet host that describes it either by its name or address. echoreq.c uses this in the line "ptrh = gethostbyname(host);"
which stores the pointer to host in the variable ptrh, which is a hostent type struct pointer to a host table entry.

5. The alternative method is getaddressinfo. This is different than gethostname because it has more functionality, such as its ability to work like getservbyname as well.

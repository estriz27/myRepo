The difference between socket and pipe being that a pipe is unidirectional but a socket is two way, and socket connects computers together while pipe connects processes. A file is similar to these two as well in that it is a method of sending information, but unlike a pipe it does not connect two processes, but it is unidirectional as well.The sockets address each other by first creating the socket, and then assigning the ip number to where the connection is coming in using bind.The purpose of bind is to assigns the IP/port number to the socket where the connection to the other is coming in. In short bind assigns an address to the socket referred to by the file descriptor. This is found in echod.cThe purpose of connect is to connect the socket to the server it is to communicate with.Listen is used to mark the socket that is going to be receiving the information. In echod.c listen is used to test if the information is sending correctly. It uses the socket descriptor, sd, and QLEN states how long the accepted queue is allowed to be. If itâ€™s smaller than zero, something went wrong. Accept is used in echod.c to determine whether or not the connection between the socket and the server is working. It accepts the first connection request on the queue. It is used in this program to try to accept the first request on the stack, if it returns less than zero this means that the size of the peer address was determined to be less than zero, which means an error must have occurred.To send and receive messages the functions sendmsg and receive can be used.

1.1.  The program leads to deadlock.
1.2. Reasons for deadlock in this situation include mutual exclusion. This is that only one philosopher can use a chopstick at a time. 
Also, hold and wait. A philosopher will hold on to a chopstick and not put it down until it has received another one and eaten. 
No preemption. The philosophers cannot be preemted. Therefore they must eat before they can put down the chopsticks. 
Lastly circular wait.If a philosopher only has one chopstick, it will wait for another philosopher who has the chopstick they are waiting for to put it back down. 
This leads to deadlock because if a philosopher is waiting on a chopstick which is being used by another philosopher who is waiting on another chopstick etc. they can all be waiting and deadlock will occur.


2.1 What I obeserved is that all deadlocks occured with the last 3 lines being one picking up chopsticks, followed by a hungry line, followed by another philosopher picking up chopsticks. This lead to deadlock because both philosophers were waiting for a chopstick that was being held by another philosopher.

3.1 These solutions don't eliminate mututal exclusion, hold and wait, no preemtion, or circular wait. All of these can still be problems. The only thing that it does is to try to change the order in which chopsticks are taken to reduce the possibility of deadlock. It is still very possible for a philosopher to be waiting on a chopstick which is being used by someone else, who is also waiting on another philosopher.

Problem 1 is working correctly
Problem 2 is working correcly
I think problem 3 is working correctly. It defintiely was when I 
committed it, but there was an issue with my git at some point
becuase I tried to commit locally and it may have pushed the wrong
summation.c file at some point. I will speak to Professor Marchiori tomorrow
to help me fix my local git repository.
Problem 4 is working correctly

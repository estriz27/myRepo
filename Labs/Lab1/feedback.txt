lab1 problem 1 a): fork.c compiles

	Comment: Good

lab1 problem 1 b): describe how num is shared or not with the child
	Score: 5 / 5
	Comment: Good

lab1 problem 1 c): fork-wait.c waits for the child to exit
	Score: 10 / 10
	Comment: Well done

lab1 problem 2 a): Read fork-data.c carefully, then compile and run it. In answers.txt explain in
which segment of your running program the following variables reside: pid, x,
y, i, j, and pid.
	Score: 2 / 4
	Comment: y, i, and j are on the stack

lab1 problem 2 b): In answers.txt, discuss whether running fork-data.c allows you to conclude:
(1) if the data segment and the stack segment of a parent process are copied
over to the child process; (2) whether changes made to these variables by the
child are seen by the parent. What you discover for (2) will tell you whether
parent and child share the same memory for data and stack segments or if they
each have their own separate segments.

lab1 problem 2 c): fork-file.c compiles and writes and reads 5 characters
	Score: 5 / 6
	Comment: Good, but these results show little since the child did not begin reading from the beginning of the file.

lab1 problem 2 d): Answers to the following questions: (1) if one process closes the file, can
the other still read from it?; (2) say the child process reads from the
?inherited? file; does that affect what the parent will read from the same
file descriptor?
	Score: 4 / 6
	Comment: When using system calls, a read in one process does affect the read position of the other process.

lab1 problem 2 e): Created Fork wrapper for fork that checks for error and if so uses perror/exit

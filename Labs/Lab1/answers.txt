Problem 1:

b) There exists two instances of num, one in the memory space of the child and one in the memory space of the parent. This is because the fork() function gives the child its own memory space, also when printed the parent and child have two different values for num.

Problem 2:
a) pid,j, and y i and x are all in the data segment of the code.

b) 1) Yes, the data segment and stack segment are copied over to a child process from a parent. 2) The changes made by a child to the variables are not seen by the parent. This is because the parent and child do not share memory, but rather have different segments of data that they refer to.

d) If one process closes the file the other is still able to read from it.
No, the processes don't affect eachother. The parent continues reading from where it left off, and the child process starts from where the child left off (since theres only one child process, it starts from the beginning of the file).
